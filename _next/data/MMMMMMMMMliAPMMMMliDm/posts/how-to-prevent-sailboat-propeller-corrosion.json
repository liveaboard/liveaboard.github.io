Who should worry about propeller corrosion? Propeller corrosion is usually more of an issue for those who keep their sailboats in salt water.</p>\n<p>What causes propeller corrosion? When there are two dissimilar metals in salt water, like a bronze propeller and a stainless steel propeller shaft, the less noble metal's electrons will flow into the more noble metal. Between a bronze propeller and a stainless steel propeller shaft, the propeller will corrode and give its electrons to the propeller shaft.</p>\n<p>How can you prevent propeller corrosion? Simply introduce a third, less noble metal into the mix, like zinc. This third metal is called an anode. Typically, anodes are installed on the propeller shaft. The anode will wear away over time, and in many cases will need to be replaced annually. In order to replace your anode, you can hire a diver (which can be costly!) or do it yourself by diving or hauling your sailboat out.</p>\n<p>It's possible to use extra anodes in certain situations, like when your sailboat is left at its slip. These extra anodes are known as hanging anodes, and are designed to supplement your sailboat's existing anode.</p>\n","date":"2020-11-06","title":"How to prevent sailboat propeller corrosion"}},"__N_SSG":true}
