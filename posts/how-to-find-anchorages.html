As a liveaboard, you'll need a place to keep your sailboat overnight. Options include marinas and yacht clubs, mooring balls, and anchorages. A perk of anchorages is that they're free.</p>
<p>How can you find anchorages? There's a few ways, using nautical charts, cruising guides, and online services.</p>
<h1>Nautical charts</h1>
<p>It's likely that you have a nautical chart in your sailboat already! With nautical charts, you can easily see the water depths in an area, which can help you identify good anchorages. It's important to pay special attention to the year that your nautical chart was produced, as over time, depths can change.</p>
<h1>Cruising guides</h1>
<p>Cruising guides are helpful resources to cruisers. Cruising guides can point out many important things about an area that cruisers would find helpful, like information about various harbors in an area. Most cruising guides include information about anchorages. It's also important to pay attention to the year that the cruising guide was published, since anchorages can change. Other information in the cruising guide can become out-of-date too.</p>
<h1>Online services</h1>
<p>There's also online services that can help you find anchorages. One such service is called ActiveCaptain, which is a website that offers crowdsourced information about anchorages, marinas, and other nautical resources. ActiveCaptain's map lets sailors identify anchorages and add reviews of them. You might not find detailed information about anchorages in ActiveCaptain, but you're likely to find experiences from plenty of sailors.</p>
