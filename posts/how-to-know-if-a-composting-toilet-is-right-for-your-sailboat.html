<h1>Cost</h1>
<p>Composting toilets can be expensive, even surpassing $1,000, with regular toilets being much cheaper. At first glance, composting toilets seem expensive, though it's important to compare them with regular toilets and the total cost of their system. Regular toilets require holding tanks, thru-hulls, sometimes pumps and even more.</p>
<h1>Smell</h1>
<p>Since the waste doesn't go into a holding tank, it's necessary to manage the smell. Most composting toilets are set up with a vent fan, to direct the smell of the waste outside. The vent fan gets hooked up the the sailboat's power supply. It's important to keep the vent fan going constantly! In addition to diverting the smell, the vent fan can help dry the waste in the composting toilet.</p>
<h1>Size</h1>
<p>With a composting toilet, you'll still need to "empty the tank" regularly. Many composting toilets can handle holding solid waste for about six weeks, but it's necessary to empty the fluid waste every few days. Waste can be dispersed overboard as long as law permits, or inland if you're at a mooring.</p>
<h1>Recurring costs</h1>
<p>What might surprise regular toilet users is that composting toilets have recurring costs. It's recommended to put composting material in your composting toilet after emptying it. Common composting materials are coconut coir and peat moss.</p>
