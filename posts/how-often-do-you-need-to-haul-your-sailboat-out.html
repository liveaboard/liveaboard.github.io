In many places, sailboat haulouts need to be planned ahead of time and cost money. Knowing when and why your sailboat might need to be hauled out can help you plan and budget for your haulout.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors of how often you need to haul your sailboat out is the condition of the hull's antifouling paint. Antifouling paint is applied to the hull of a sailboat to slow the growth of organisms. Depending on what type of water you keep your sailboat in, you might need to repaint the hull every few years (salt water) or even less often (fresh water). Regular cleaning of the hull will extend the life of your antifouling paint, so you won't need to haul your sailboat out as often.</p>
<p>Besides repainting the hull, you might need to haul your sailboat out in order to perform repairs or inspect the hull. In many circumstances, inspection and repairs to the keel, propeller, and rudder will be easier with the sailboat hauled out.</p>
